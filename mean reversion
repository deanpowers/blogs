BTC and ETH Mean Reversion 

Core Concept: What is Mean Reversion?

Mean reversion is the financial theory that suggests asset prices and financial metrics tend to move back toward their historical average or mean over time.

Think of it like a rubber band:

· When stretched too far in one direction, it tends to snap back
· When compressed too much, it tends to expand back to its normal length

In trading terms: Extreme moves are often followed by counter-moves toward the average.

The Three Components

1. BTC/ETH Price Ratio

Ratio = Price of BTC ÷ Price of ETH

· This measures their relative value
· A ratio of 20 means 1 BTC is worth 20 ETH
· It filters out overall crypto market moves and focuses on the relationship between these two assets

2. Historical Mean of the Ratio

This is the average ratio over a chosen lookback period (e.g., 90 days, 1 year).
Mean Ratio = (Sum of Daily Ratios) ÷ Number of Days

3. Z-Score of the Ratio

Z-Score = (Current Ratio - Mean Ratio) ÷ Standard Deviation

· This normalizes how far the current ratio is from its mean
· It tells you how “exceptional” the current deviation is

How Mean Reversion Works with the Z-Score

The Mental Model

```
Extreme High Z-Score → Ratio is stretched → Expect snap back toward mean
Extreme Low Z-Score → Ratio is compressed → Expect expansion toward mean
```

Practical Trading Process

Step 1: Calculate the Z-Score

```python
# Example calculation
current_ratio = 18.5
mean_ratio = 15.0
std_deviation = 1.5

z_score = (18.5 - 15.0) / 1.5 = 2.33
```

Step 2: Interpret the Z-Score

· Z > +2.0: Ratio is ~2+ standard deviations above mean → BTC overvalued relative to ETH
· Z < -2.0: Ratio is ~2+ standard deviations below mean → ETH overvalued relative to BTC
· Z ≈ 0: Ratio is near historical average

Step 3: Execute Mean Reversion Trades

Scenario A: High Positive Z-Score (+2.33)

· Interpretation: BTC is statistically expensive relative to ETH
· Mean Reversion Expectation: Ratio should decrease toward its mean
· Trade: Short the Ratio (Bet on ETH outperforming BTC)
  · Sell BTC
  · Buy ETH
  · Dollar-neutral position (equal $ value on both sides)

Scenario B: Low Negative Z-Score (-2.1)

· Interpretation: ETH is statistically expensive relative to BTC
· Mean Reversion Expectation: Ratio should increase toward its mean
· Trade: Long the Ratio (Bet on BTC outperforming ETH)
  · Buy BTC
  · Sell ETH
  · Dollar-neutral position

Concrete Example

Let’s walk through a real scenario:

Historical Data (90-day lookback):

· Mean BTC/ETH Ratio: 16.0
· Standard Deviation: 2.0

Current Market:

· BTC Price: $40,000
· ETH Price: $2,000
· Current Ratio: 20.0 ($40,000 ÷ $2,000)

Z-Score Calculation:

```
Z = (20.0 - 16.0) ÷ 2.0 = 2.0
```

Interpretation & Action:

· Z-score of +2.0 indicates BTC is strongly overvalued vs ETH
· Mean reversion probability is high
· Execute Trade:
  · Short $10,000 worth of BTC
  · Long $10,000 worth of ETH
  · Net market exposure: ~$0 (pure relative value trade)

Expected Outcome:

· Scenario 1: BTC falls to $38,000, ETH rises to $2,200 → Ratio = 17.3 (moving toward mean)
· Scenario 2: BTC stays at $40,000, ETH rises to $2,350 → Ratio = 17.0 (moving toward mean)
· Scenario 3: BTC falls to $36,000, ETH stays at $2,000 → Ratio = 18.0 (moving toward mean)

In all cases, the trade profits if the ratio decreases, regardless of absolute price direction.

Why Does Mean Reversion Work with BTC/ETH?

1. Psychological Levels: Traders notice extreme valuations and take counter-positions
2. Profit-Taking: After strong outperformance, traders rotate into the underperforming asset
3. Fundamental Gravity: While BTC and ETH have different use cases, they’re still correlated crypto assets
4. Market Structure: Large players execute statistical arbitrage, pushing prices toward equilibrium

Critical Considerations & Risks

1. Lookback Period Sensitivity

```python
# Different periods give different signals
short_term_mean = 15.0  # 30-day lookback  
long_term_mean = 18.0   # 1-year lookback
```

· Short lookbacks: More signals, but more false signals
· Long lookbacks: Fewer signals, but potentially more reliable

2. Regime Changes

The “mean” can shift permanently due to:

· Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake
· Bitcoin ETF approvals
· Major protocol upgrades
· Changing market structure

3. The Most Dangerous Phrase: “This Time Is Different”

Sometimes, extreme moves are justified by fundamentals and mean reversion fails. The ratio can stay extended for long periods during strong trends.

4. Risk Management Essentials

· Stop-losses: Exit if z-score becomes even more extreme (e.g., goes from +2.5 to +3.0)
· Position sizing: Don’t bet too much on any single mean reversion
· Correlation breaks: Monitor if the fundamental relationship changes

Advanced Mean Reversion Strategies

Dynamic Z-Score Bands:

· Adjust threshold based on recent volatility
· Use tighter bands in low-volatility regimes
· Use wider bands in high-volatility regimes

Multiple Timeframe Confirmation:

· Check z-score on daily, weekly, and monthly timeframes
· Only trade when multiple timeframes align

Momentum Filter:

· Avoid mean reversion trades when strong momentum is present
· Use additional indicators to confirm mean reversion is likely

Summary

The mean reversion framework using the BTC/ETH z-score is essentially:

1. Measure how extreme the current ratio is vs history (z-score)
2. Bet that extremes will normalize (mean revert)
3. Execute dollar-neutral pairs trades (long one asset, short the other)
4. Profit from the convergence, regardless of overall market direction

This approach transforms the problem from “Will BTC go up or down?” to “Will BTC outperform ETH?” – which is often a more statistically predictable question.

The key insight is that while absolute prices are hard to predict, relative relationships between correlated assets often exhibit more predictable, mean-reverting behavior.
